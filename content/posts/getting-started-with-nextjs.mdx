# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features that make building web applications faster and more enjoyable. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces several improvements:

- **Turbopack**: The new Rust-based bundler is now stable
- **Server Actions**: Simplified data mutations
- **Partial Prerendering**: Better performance with selective rendering
- **Improved Image Component**: Better loading performance

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new project with all the latest features enabled.

## Project Structure

The modern Next.js app directory structure looks like this:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx    # Root layout
├── page.tsx      # Home page
├── globals.css   # Global styles
└── api/          # API routes
```

## Key Concepts

### Server Components

By default, all components in the app directory are Server Components. This means they render on the server and send minimal JavaScript to the client.

### Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `"use client"` directive:

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when needed
2. **Optimize images** - Always use the Next.js Image component
3. **Implement proper SEO** - Use metadata exports
4. **Cache effectively** - Leverage Next.js caching strategies

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 makes it easier than ever to build fast, scalable web applications. Start with the basics and gradually explore more advanced features as your project grows.
