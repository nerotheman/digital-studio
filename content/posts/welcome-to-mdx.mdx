# Welcome to MDX

This is our first blog post using **MDX** instead of Sanity CMS. MDX allows us to write content in Markdown while also being able to use React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

### Benefits of MDX

- **Component Support**: Use React components directly in your content
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Version Control**: Content lives in your repository
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for a separate CMS

## Code Example

Here's how you can use a React component in MDX:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

<Button>Click me!</Button>
```

## What's Next?

We'll be migrating all our existing content from Sanity to MDX format. This gives us better control over our content and reduces complexity in our stack.

Stay tuned for more updates!
